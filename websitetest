<h1>My Dog Mabrey</h1>

<h2>By Frank Perrino</h2>

  <p>Mabrey is a two year old golden retriever. She was born in West Hartford
  and we adopted her two years ago. Though she is now two she still acts like
a puppy and loves to chew on toys or go through our trash. She also never gets
tired of play time or tired on walks. Some of her favorite hobbies include
chasing squirells and running through the forrest, although she does love to
take long naps as well. From the time she was first adopted Mabrey has been the
glue that holds the family together. Withought her I don't know where we would
be today. </p>

<p>This website will be dedicated to Mabrey. Below is a picture of mabrey as a puppy, as well as several tabs dedicated to some of her
  very unique charachteristics<p/>

    <h3>Mabrey's Favorite Things to Do</h3>
    <p> Mabrey is a dog. Therefore she loves to do many of the same things
    that dogs usually do. She loves playing with her toys outside. Her favorite
    toys include her rope for tug of war, and any type of stuffed animal that
    she can attack. She also enjoys going on long walks where there is plenty
   of nature to explore and new smells in in the forrest. However, unlike most
  dogs, she dislikes rides in the car, as these make her nausous and
 uncomfortable. </p>

  <div id="Relaxation" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>Mabrey's favorite relaxation spots</h3>
    Another major part of Mabrey's life is relaxation. Much like a two year old
    human would, she will not rest for most of the day and is constantly running
    around. Then at about 8:00 pm she climbs onto her bed or the couch and
    promptly tries to sleep. She does not care if the lights are on or if There
    is noise around her, if she is tired she will sleep. On certain occasions
    she will jump in bed with one of our family members, but most of the time
    she sticks to her bed or her couch.

  <div id="Foods" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>Mabrey's favorite foods</h3>
    Mabrey's life, when it is not focused on her family, is focused on her next
    meal. Any time one of us is making food she is right there waiting for
    something to drop. Then when we are eating the food, she will be right
    there again waiting for us to giver her something. It is not that she is
    starving, far from it, she just craves for human food and is usually
    rewarded. It is tough to resist when she starts to beg anyway.
